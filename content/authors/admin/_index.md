I am a postdoc in the labs of [Matthew Wilson](http://mit.edu/org/w/wilsonlab/) and [Samuel Gershman](https://gershmanlab.com/).  I'm interested in how the brain bootstraps its experiences into knowledge that can be used to organize and learn from future experiences. My work uses computational approaches such as probabilistic inference to create hypotheses about biological learning in the brain.  I also collect and analyze data from rodent hippocampus.
